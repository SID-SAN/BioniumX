**Bionium-X** is a rigorous, pure-Python scientific library for high-performance exoplanetary biosignature detection and atmospheric modeling. It provides the foundational mathematical, statistical, and machine-learning frameworks required for analyzing high-resolution transmission and emission spectra.

By parsing highly-dimensional signals from orbital telescopes, the system probabilistically estimates the presence of critical biological precursors—thereby advancing the automated search for extraterrestrial life.

## 🔭 Key Scientific Features

* **Real Observational Data Ingestion**: Seamlessly fetch and load real JWST (e.g., WASP-39b) and Hubble spectroscopic data from public archives using the internal `datasets` module.
* **Astrobiological Physics & Habitability**: Compute Earth Similarity Indices (ESI) and habitability scores constrained by equilibrium temperatures and planetary radii.
* **Chemical Disequilibrium Detection**: Simultaneously analyze detection significances of multiple reactive molecules (O₂, CH₄, N₂O) to identify highly active, life-supporting atmospheric thermodynamics.
* **Advanced Signal Processing**: Built-in methods for Savitzky-Golay filtering, 1D Gaussian smoothing, and polynomial continuum normalization for accurate feature extraction.
* **Template Cross-Correlation**: Native connection to the Harvard HITRAN API via `radis` to fetch theoretical high-resolution absorption templates and perform Voigt-broadened cross-correlation to confidently detect specific gases.
* **Bayesian Inference**: Compare atmospheric models quantitatively using Bayes Factors to weigh the statistical evidence of biosignatures.
* **Machine Learning Interoperability**: Experimental 1D CNNs, Random Forests, and Spectral Transformers for automated feature extraction and multi-label probability prediction.

## 💻 Quickstart: Detecting CO₂ in WASP-39b

Here is a simple example of fetching real JWST data, smoothing it, and using cross-correlation to detect Carbon Dioxide:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from bioniumx.datasets.fetch_real import fetch_wasp39b
from bioniumx.datasets.ingestion import load_spectrum
from bioniumx.spectra import TransmissionSpectrum
from bioniumx.preprocessing import savitzky_golay, continuum_normalize
from bioniumx.molecules.catalog import get_template
from bioniumx.detection.cross_correlation import cross_correlate_template, plot_ccf

# 1. Fetch & Load Real JWST Data
csv_path = fetch_wasp39b()
wavelength, flux, noise = load_spectrum(csv_path)

spec = TransmissionSpectrum(
    wavelength=wavelength, transit_depth=flux, err=noise,
    target_name="WASP-39b", instrument="JWST/NIRISS"
)

# 2. Preprocess: Smooth and Normalize
spec_smoothed = savitzky_golay(spec, window=15, polyorder=3)
spec_norm = continuum_normalize(spec_smoothed, method="polynomial", degree=2)

# 3. Cross-Correlate against HITRAN CO2 Template
wl_co2, depth_co2 = get_template("CO2", resolving_power=100)
result = cross_correlate_template(spec_norm, wl_co2, depth_co2)

# 4. Plot the Peak
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))
plot_ccf(result, target_molecule="CO2", ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

## 🧬 Scientific Background

A single atmospheric gas is rarely indicative of life. However, combinations of highly reactive gases that rapidly destroy each other (such as Methane and Oxygen) violate thermodynamic equilibrium. Unless replenished by geologic or continuous biological processes (like photosynthesis and methanogenesis), these combinations would not persist. Bionium-X identifies these disequilibrium thresholds using rigorous statistical models.
