**Bionium-X** is a rigorous, pure-Python scientific library for high-performance exoplanetary biosignature detection and atmospheric modeling. 

Inspired by the architectural standards of modern astrophysics tools like `Stingray <https://docs.stingray.science/>`_, it provides the foundational mathematical, statistical, and machine-learning frameworks required for analyzing transmission and emission spectra.

Why Bionium-X?
--------------
- **Rigorous Data Objects**: Powerful :class:`~bioniumx.spectra.transmission.TransmissionSpectrum` and `EmissionSpectrum` classes that handle masking, error propagation, and physical metadata natively.
- **Advanced Chemistry**: Calculate complex atmospheric chemical disequilibrium scores (weighted by chemical lifetimes) to search for biological imbalances.
- **Physical Limits**: Evaluate heuristic habitability scores based on the Earth Similarity Index, Goldilocks Zones, and atmospheric scale heights.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Seamlessly interface with deep learning architectures (like 1D CNNs) via lazy-loaded network weights using Pooch.
