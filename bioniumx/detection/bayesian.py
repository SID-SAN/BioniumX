    """
    Calculate the Bayes Factor (K) comparing two models.

    The Bayes factor is the ratio of the marginal likelihoods (evidences)
    of two competing models. In atmospheric retrieval, M1 might be a model
    containing a specific molecule, and M2 is the model without it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    evidence_m1 : float
        Log-evidence (ln Z) for model 1.
    evidence_m2 : float
        Log-evidence (ln Z) for model 2.

    Returns
    -------
    K : float
        The Bayes factor K = Z1 / Z2. Returns float('inf') if numerical overflow.
